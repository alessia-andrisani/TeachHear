TeachHear helps language teachers who want to engage their students better by simplifying the preparation for classes using songs to create exercises.
___
TeachHear has been developed with `SwiftUI` for `iPad` running `iOS 15.2` or later. 
The lyrics of the songs are retrieved from the `Musixmatch` API and the `YouTube` API is used to play the music video in a player embedded in the app.

TeachHear has been localised in 5 languages: English, Italian, French, Spanish and German.
